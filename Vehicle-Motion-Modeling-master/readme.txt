This is a nonlinear four wheel model which runs very fast.
The motion of the model is mapped in the 3D animation sink and can be recorded.
A good usage of this model could be the simulation and validation of motion control algorithms.
If you have any questions or advices please leave a message or contact me via m.sc.tianyu.liao@gmail.com.
At the moment I don't plan to share the source code of the s-functions, sorry.
Please use the Windows 64 bit version of MatLab.
